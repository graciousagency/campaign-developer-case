To properly assert your level as a campaign developer we would like you to do the following case.
Read the briefing carefully! Go nuts and dazzle us.

## The Case
Convert our graceful insights newsletter design to a working html mailing. 
The mailing should be fully responsive and spam-friendly (not a bunch of images stitched together).

In the repo you'll also find the following:
* `/assets`: all design assets that can be used to build the mailing
* `/fonts`: the custom font we use and that's part of our branding
* `/design/`: the design you need to build

## How?
How do we want you to do it? We don't care, make it in tables (obviously), mjml or any other framework/IDE you're used to.
Just make sure your end result contains a readable version of your code (non-minified).

Make sure it is something you're proud of and shows us your knowledge and abilities!

### Missing assets?
Probably true. Show us how you deal with limitations :) 

### Client support
At gracious we support the following clients, your end result should at least support:
* Outlook 2016 and newer (Windows & OSX)
* OSX/Apple Mail (latest 2 versions)
* iOS/Apple Mail (latest 2 versions)
* Android Mail (latest version)
* Outlook.com (& Office 365)
  * Chrome (latest 2 major versions)
  * Firefox (latest 2 major versions)
  * Edge (latest 2 major versions)
* Gmail.com
    * Chrome (latest 2 major versions)
    * Firefox (latest 2 major versions)
    * Edge (latest 2 major versions)

## Bonus points
